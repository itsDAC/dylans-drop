                             <h4>About me..</h4>
      <p>
          I am a very friendly and energetic person who is comfortable meeting new people. 
          <br>
          I have a good awareness of industry issues and trends, particularly in regards to accessibility, usability, emerging technologies and open source CMS. I am an ambitious type who wants to get noticed, and have the drive and energy needed to really make a difference to a project. The thing I love about web development is the transformation from code to a physical website. Plus I love knowing that there is so much to learn and I feel will never get bored. 
          I am a computer gamer but I also enjoy the outdoors especially the beach and bush walking. 
          I am passionate and ready to learn more (I’ve been told that I’m really coachable). I’d love to hear about any opportunities short or long term.

         <h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>

      <p>
        <i>
          "I would like to take this opportunity to highly recommend  Dylan as a website developer.
          He was extremely professional and so helpful in giving me advice and
          direction about the layout and execution of my website. Nothing was ever
          too much trouble. I was really impressed with his creative flair for
          design and the construction of the website. Throughout the whole
          process he always took the time to explain things in detail and this made
          the whole process so much easier.
          I can’t wait to work with him again and would not hesitate to recommend him to others."
